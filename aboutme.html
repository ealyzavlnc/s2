	<!--Motivation added-->
	<p>When I was young, I dreamt about being a licensed civil engineer as i have had a shallow idea as how to be one and how they work on field. As I was in mg 12th grade, I took up STEM track and took a major in Computer System Servicing as it was the closest to engineering. We were taught the basics in creating a network, how to create a usable cable for networks and how to test connections. It was then that I developed my love for computers, systems, and networks. But I tried to still pursue engineering by taking the entrance exam in a state university in our province. Fortunately, I passed. But I didn't feel as happy as I expected that I'll be. That's when I knew that Information Technology is the right course for me. In my first year, I experienced hardships and I really struggled in one of my subjects which is considered a core one in my course as it was Programming. I felt that I wanted to quit but thank God that He did not let me as I am now getting a grip of how an IT learns and works.</p>
