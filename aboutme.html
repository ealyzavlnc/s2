	<!--Initial Commit-->
	<h2>My name is Ealyza Valencia. We are currently residing in Malolos, Bulacan.</h2>
	<h2>I am a third year student taking up Bachelor of Science in Technology at CEU Malolos. </h2>
	<h3>I used to love going around using my bike but as the pandemic happened, I learned to love and care about plants and now i have dozens.</h3>
	<!--Motivation added-->
	<p>When I was young, I dreamt about being a licensed civil engineer as i have had a shallow idea as how to be one and how they work on field. As I was in mg 12th grade, I took up STEM track and took a major in Computer System Servicing as it was the closest to engineering. We were taught the basics in creating a network, how to create a usable cable for networks and how to test connections. It was then that I developed my love for computers, systems, and networks. But I tried to still pursue engineering by taking the entrance exam in a state university in our province. Fortunately, I passed. But I didn't feel as happy as I expected that I'll be. That's when I knew that Information Technology is the right course for me. In my first year, I experienced hardships and I really struggled in one of my subjects which is considered a core one in my course as it was Programming. I felt that I wanted to quit but thank God that He did not let me as I am now getting a grip of how an IT learns and works.</p>
	<!-- Experiences added -->
	<p>I took up IT with excitement and enthusiasm. I didn't put in my mind that it'll be tough or hard or challenging. All I thought about is that 'I think I know enough to survive IT' but little did I know that IT could really push me to all my limits in doing a work like sleepless nights and such. I remember when I was in first year, I always tell my mom that 'Mommy, can I shift?' or 'Mommy, baka may bagsak ako this sem'. My mom always tell me that even if I shift courses, there's no such thing as an easy course and that I should love my current course and be passionate so that I could turn th 'sleepless nights' into 'fun and productive nights'. Lesson learned. I turned my frustrations into inspirations and here I am, I was able to learn and I had fun while learning. Thanks to my classmates and friends who struggled, learned and laughed with me, and thanks to my professors who had the patience to deal with all us.</p>
